Yes, in **binary segmentation**, you **can compute the Dice coefficient from mIoU**, because both metrics are based on the same quantities: **True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN)**. Let me explain carefully.

---

### Definitions:

1. **Intersection over Union (IoU)** or Jaccard Index:

$$
\text{IoU} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP + FN}
$$

2. **Dice coefficient (F1 score for segmentation)**:

$$
\text{Dice} = \frac{2 \cdot TP}{2 \cdot TP + FP + FN}
$$

---

### Relationship between Dice and IoU:

You can express Dice in terms of IoU:

$$
\text{Dice} = \frac{2 \cdot \text{IoU}}{1 + \text{IoU}}
$$

And conversely:

$$
\text{IoU} = \frac{\text{Dice}}{2 - \text{Dice}}
$$

✅ **This works exactly for binary segmentation**, because there’s only one foreground class and one background class.

---

### Important caveat:

* If your segmentation is **multi-class**, the relationship is **not straightforward**. You would need to compute class-wise IoUs and then combine them carefully (weighted average or mean), and the Dice cannot be exactly derived from the mean IoU in general.

---

So for binary segmentation, yes — **from mIoU you can always compute Dice** using:

$$
\text{Dice} = \frac{2 \cdot \text{mIoU}}{1 + \text{mIoU}}
$$

If you want, I can also **show a quick numerical example** to see it in action. Do you want me to?
